# Copilot instructions (heisenberg)

## PDF / LaTeX compilation
- This repo is *not* compiled locally in this environment.
- The author uses **OpenAI Prism (online)** to generate the PDF output from `heisenberg.tex`.
- Do not assume `pdflatex` / MiKTeX / TeX Live is installed or available on PATH.

## Editing guidance
- Prefer changes that keep the manuscript self-contained (no external `.bib` dependency unless requested).
- When adding math, keep it coordinate-free / invariant when practical, consistent with the paper’s current framing.
